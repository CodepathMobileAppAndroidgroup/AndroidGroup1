### App Idea Evaluation


- Mobile: Can be used on both web and the phone equally; however, should start as an app. Similair to GroupMe.
- Story: Students taking the same course can help each other out, post study guides, and just communicate in general
- Market: Targeted for college students
- Habit: Users will be communicating regularly and discussing up-coming tests/homeworks
- Scope: Starts small, just connecting students taking the same course at the same school
