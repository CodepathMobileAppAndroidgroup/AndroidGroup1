Same Course Connecting App

App Description

An app that allows students all over the nation to connect based on the courses that they are taking and allows them to talk, work, and collaborate together and creates a work space for students to help them succeed.

App Idea Evaluation

Mobile: Can be used on both web and the phone equally; however, should start as an app. Similair to GroupMe.
Story: Students taking the same course can help each other out, post study guides, and just communicate in general
Market: Targeted for college students
Habit: Users will be communicating regularly and discussing up-coming tests/homeworks
Scope: Starts small, just connecting students taking the same course at the same school
